                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>My real name is Lu Shuo and I am currently studying software engineering at Guangxi University of Science and Technology.</p>
                <p>Hobbies of playing the <em>piano</em>, <em>writing code</em>, and <em>computer graphics</em>.</p> 
                <p>
                    Born in 2005 in Henan Province, China, I grew up immersed in the rich cultural heritage of China's Central Plains, which instilled in me both resilience and diligence from an early age.
            
                    My educational journey began at HEPS-ZD Elementary School (2011-2017), where I developed foundational academic skills and a lifelong curiosity for learning. I then attended HEMS-WB Middle School (2017-2020), strengthening my analytical abilities while exploring diverse subjects.
                    
                    During my high school years at ZZ11Z (2020-2023), I cultivated critical thinking and time management skills that prepared me for higher education. In 2023, I proudly enrolled at GXUST, where I'm currently pursuing software engineering while embracing new academic challenges.
                    
                    Rooted in Henan's pragmatic spirit yet globally curious, I strive to bridge theoretical knowledge with real-world applications. As I continue this journey, I aim to grow as a committed learner while staying true to my core values of perseverance.
